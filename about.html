  <h2>About AFPP</h2>
  <p>
    Founded in 2024, Amritsar Food and Parantha Point (AFPP) was born from a simple dream — 
    to bring the authentic flavors of Indian food to every plate. What started as a small kitchen 
    serving homestyle parathas and tiffin meals soon grew into a trusted food destination known 
    for its warmth, quality, and tradition.
  </p>

  <p>
    At AFPP, every dish tells a story — of the streets of Amritsar, the aroma of fresh ghee, and 
    the love that goes into home-cooked food. From buttery parathas and rich Chole Bhature to 
    hearty thalis and evening chai-time snacks, our menu celebrates the essence of North Indian 
    comfort food.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe in serving fresh, flavorful, and fulfilling meals that make you feel at home, no matter 
    where you are. Whether you’re stopping by for breakfast or ordering a cozy dinner, AFPP is here 
    to serve you happiness — one bite at a time.
